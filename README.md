## 17. Protein Folding using Quantum Computer
Name of Mentor: <a href="https://github.com/raghavven">V Raghavendra</a> <br>

<b>Brief Description:</b> Understanding the nature of folding of macromolecules like proteins, DNA and RNA is central to the problems in the fields of molecular bio-physics/chemistry, bioinformatics etc. Predicting the 3D structures of proteins is of paramount significance for efficient drug discovery, medicine, crop production and other biotechnology based applications. Although conventional methods make use of classical molecular modeling techniques such as molecular dynamics to understand the protein folding problem, the classical approach has its own limitations and the problem becomes almost intractable for real life macromolecules. With the onset of quantum revolution, we aim to use the state-of-the-art quantum computer and coarse grained based technique to efficiently predict the 3D structure of the proteins.

<b>Our Projcet:</b> In this project, I first reviewed the Qiskit Nature tutorial on Protein Folding Problem, then changed the interaction model from Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) to Hydrophobic-polar (HP) model.

The main repository for this event was in <a href="https://github.com/QIntern-2022/">this account</a>, but as it is a private repository, I copied my code here.
