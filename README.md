## 17. Protein Folding using Quantum Computer
Name of Mentor: <a href="https://github.com/raghavven">V Raghavendra</a> <br>

<b>Brief Description:</b> Understanding the nature of folding of macromolecules like proteins, DNA and RNA is central to the problems in the fields of molecular bio-physics/chemistry, bioinformatics etc. Predicting the 3D structures of proteins is of paramount significance for efficient drug discovery, medicine, crop production and other biotechnology based applications. Although conventional methods make use of classical molecular modeling techniques such as molecular dynamics to understand the protein folding problem, the classical approach has its own limitations and the problem becomes almost intractable for real life macromolecules. With the onset of quantum revolution, we aim to use the state-of-the-art quantum computer and coarse grained based technique to efficiently predict the 3D structure of the proteins.

<b>Our Projcet:</b> In this project, I first reviewed the Qiskit Nature tutorial on Protein Folding Problem, then changed the interaction model from Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) to Hydrophobic-polar (HP) model.

The main repository for this event was in <a href="https://github.com/QIntern-2022/">this account</a>, but as it is a private repository, I copied my code here.

## How to use this repository?
You can first read the <a href="https://github.com/yadavar-m/QIntern-2022/blob/main/1-ProteinFoldingProblem.ipynb">first notebook</a> which is the introduction to the Protein Folding Problem. Then you can learn how to use Qiskit Nature Proteing Folding Package to solve the problem in the <a href="https://github.com/yadavar-m/QIntern-2022/blob/main/2-ProteinFolding_QiskitNature.ipynb">second notebook</a>. I explained more about Miyazawa-Jernigan Interaction Model in the <a href="https://github.com/yadavar-m/QIntern-2022/blob/main/3-ProteinFolding_Miyazawa_Jernigan.ipynb">third notebook</a>, and finally I replaced the Miyazawa-Jernigan model with the Hydrophobic-Polar model in the <a href="https://github.com/yadavar-m/QIntern-2022/blob/main/4-ProteinFolding_Hydrophobic_Polar.ipynb">fourth notebook</a>.
